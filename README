JANS: Java APR Numerical Solver for COHO platform 
  This package implements the numerical solver needed by RAC/FRAC. 
  It is mainly a LP solver, Gemoetry operations, and LP projection algorithms. 
  It ensures correctness, not suffering from numerical issues, as it is based on APR(arbitrary-precision-rational). 
  (Honestly, it is hybrid of double,interval, and APR for performance reasons)
